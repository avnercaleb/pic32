/* AES Key 128

  Summary:
    Using an AES key length of 128 bits.

  Description:
    When this macro is defined, an AES key length of 128 will be used.  Based on
    this 128-bit key length, the session key size and number of round required will
    be configured.

  Remarks:
    This define is exclusive and macros for 192 and 256-bit key lengths cannot be defined.

  Summary:
    Using an AES key length of 256 bits.

  Description:
    When this macro is defined, an AES key length of 256 will be used.  Based on
    this 256-bit key length, the session key size and number of round required will
    be configured.

/* AES Key Dymanic

  Summary:
    Using any AES key length (128, 192, or 256).

  Description:
    When this macro is defined, any AES key length will be used.  Based on
    the pass parameter AES_KEY_TYPE, the session key size and number of round required will
    be configured.
